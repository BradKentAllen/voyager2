##### Calculation

M = [Mx, My, Mz] from magnetometer

A = [Ax, Ay, Az] from accelerometer

###### Steps

1.  E = M cross A :  this gives vector pointing East because East is perpendicular to North and Up
2. normalize E
3. N = A cross E



 





###### Normalize a Vector

divide vector by it's magnitude creating a unit length vector

###### Dot Product

Results in scaler equal to:

###### Cross Product

Cross Product:  result is vector 90 deg to two vectors using right-hand rule with magnitude equal to area of polygon formed by the two vectors.
